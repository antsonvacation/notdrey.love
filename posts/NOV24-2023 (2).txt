when i sleep i lie still
with one arm to my chest
and another stretched out
waiting

i do not know when or where
but i do know you will find me
so i keep your side warm
i cook meals for two
buy pillows for your half
some firm some soft
because i do not know you
and you do not know me
but know that when you find me
you will find me waiting
