your mother left you
someplace safe
hugged you tight
and was on her way

somber slumber
sickly sweet
strangers scamper
savage street

a hand reaches out
and grips your leg
you plead and whimper
whine and beg
two hands now
pulling hard
despite your might
they drag you far

out from that place
your mother picked
into strangers arms
a wicked trick

but there are no sinking teeth
or biting maw,
no blade unsheathed
or blood stained claw
it holds you there
as if it was its own
you feel its heart
a familiar song
