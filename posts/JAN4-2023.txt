that domestic bliss
the soft buzz of a car horn three doors down
filtered through feet of concrete and drywall
studs places 16 inches apart on center
dinner is ready at 6pm
the dog is some shade of gold or blonde
countertops are marble and everything is name-brand

i used to want it
i never got it
i hope i never find it

parents away at 9pm for 15 minutes in heaven
the kids are awake under the covers playing video games
the camera pans out over the neighborhood, one thousand dishwashers hum in melody, a snoring husband like a double bass, soft whistles of young lungs learning to breathe for the first time, hard whistles of old lungs, still learning to breathe for the first time. a symphony of life played out over 1000 identical houses. that domestic bliss.
