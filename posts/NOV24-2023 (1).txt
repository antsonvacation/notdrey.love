on mighty bodys
they sail the sea
but in their body
they cannot see
the dangerous bodies
that lie beneath

they drag you down
deep down below
where sunlight fails
and jellyfish glow

you see my face
in inky depths
because i brought you here
mind your breath

your face turns red
youd cant hold it in
you fill your lungs
with my velvet sin

but you cant breathe
you thrash and writhe
your down to deep
youre gonna die

so you look at me
eye to eye
you say you love me
i say goodbye

once youre gone
i let you go
you sink deeper
to somewhere even i wont go
someplace ill never know
your resting place
your final home
