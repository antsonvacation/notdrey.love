you said you could love
a girl like me
but i dont think you can
my nose is too wide
my forehead is too tall
my eyes are hooded
and my lips are small

my shoulders are too broad
and my hands are quite large
but you still kiss me

on my nose then my forehead
eyelid then lips
shoulders then hands
because you meant it when you said
you loved a girl like me
