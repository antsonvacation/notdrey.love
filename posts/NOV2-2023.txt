i sit here tired
i wait for the blood to dry
but it never does
you cut too deep this time
you hit something vital
your face flushes white
your floor flushes crimson
you cut too deep this time
it hurts too much
you didn't want it like this
you didn't want this at all
you push the edges together
they fall back apart
you're panicking
you're crying
i wont stop bleeding
i cant put me back together
i cant get up off the floor
